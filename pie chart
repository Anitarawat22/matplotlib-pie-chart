1. import the matplotlib as mp
import matplotlib as mp

2. then import the pyplot from matplotlib . pyplot is a collection of functions that make matplotlib work like MATLAB.
from matplotlib import pyplot as plt

3.Now slice the no of  elements you want
slices = [40,60,20,35]

4.add labels to them
labels = ["forty","sixty","twenty","thirtyfive"]

5.colors you can write any color or use hex values
colors = ["blue","orange","yellow","green"]

6.explode =  used to explode the pie chart. If specified, it must be an array with one value representing a value for each wedge of the pie chart.
explode = [0.0,0,0.1,0]

7.shadow :- it will shadow to you
shadow = True

8.wedgeprops : used to color the outline of the pie chart .here it is green

9.startangle can adjust your angel view , here it is 0 degree
 startangle = 0

10.now use pie to plot all the names.
plt.pie(slices,labels = labels,explode= explode,shadow =True, startangle = 0,autopct = '%1.1F%%',wedgeprops={'edgecolor':'green'})

#output
